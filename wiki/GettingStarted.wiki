#summary Getting yourself setup and started

= Introduction =

The pChart for Mediawiki extension (pchart4mw) allows you to make graph charts like line-, bar-, pie-, radar-, scatter- and bubble charts. It uses the (free) PHP Chart library pChart to produce these graphs. It allows for 2- or 3-dimensional graphs, which are all within the potential of the pChart library. The graphs are based on your data from the wiki page.

pchart4mw works, together with the pChart library, fully within your MediaWiki Server environment. The data is processed completely within the server environment.

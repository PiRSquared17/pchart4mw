#summary Set yourself up and get started

=== What you need ===
The pChart for !MediaWiki extension (pchart4mw) uses the (free) PHP Chart Library pChart to create chart images. pChart4mw works, together with the pChart Library, fully within your !MediaWiki server environment. The data that is displayed in the chart is also processed within your !MediaWiki server. 

The pChart Library is not a part of the extension pchart4mw but it is a separate product. To set yourself up you need both the pChart Library AND this pChart4mw extension.

===Requirements===
You need a up-and-running !MediaWiki wiki-site. Make sure that the PHP version on your server is 5.x and has GD library with freetype extension enabled.

Check the required version of the pChart Library to use with pchart4mw on the [ReleaseNotes release notes] page.

=== Setup this extension==
There are a few simple steps to setup this extension on your !MediaWiki site:

 # [Installation Install] the pChart Library 
 # [Installation Install] the pchart4mw extension
 # [Configuration Configure] the extension so that it can be used within your site
 # [YourFirstGraph Try and test] your first chart.

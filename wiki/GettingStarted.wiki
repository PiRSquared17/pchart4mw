#summary Getting yourself setup and started

=== What you need ===
The pChart for Mediawiki extension (pchart4mw) uses the (free) PHP Chart library pChart to produce these graphs.

pchart4mw works, together with the pChart library, fully within your Mediawiki server environment. The data is processed completely within the server environment. 

To set yourself up you need both the pChart Library AND this pChart4mw extension.

===Requirements===
You need a up-and-running Mediawiki wiki-site. Make sure that the PHP version on your server is 5.x and has GD library with freetype extension enabled.

=== Get yourself setup==
There are a few simple steps you need to take to set yourself up:

 # [Installation Install] the pChart Library 
 # [Installation Install] the pchart4mw extension
 # [Configuration Configure] the extension so that it can be used within your site
 # [YourFirstGraph Try and test] your first chart.

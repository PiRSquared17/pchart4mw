#summary Set yourself up and get started

=== What you need ===
The pChart for !MediaWiki extension (pchart4mw) uses the (free) PHP Chart Library pChart to produce charts. pchart4mw works, together with the pChart Library, fully within your !MediaWiki server environment. The data is processed completely within the server environment. 

This means that the pChart Library is not part of the extension pchart4mw but it is a separate product. So to set yourself up you need both the pChart Library AND this pChart4mw extension.

===Requirements===
You need a up-and-running !MediaWiki wiki-site. Make sure that the PHP version on your server is 5.x and has GD library with freetype extension enabled.

Check the required version of the pChart Library to use with pchart4mw on the [ReleaseNotes release notes] page.

=== Set yourself up==
There are a few simple steps you need to take to set yourself up:

 # [Installation Install] the pChart Library 
 # [Installation Install] the pchart4mw extension
 # [Configuration Configure] the extension so that it can be used within your site
 # [YourFirstGraph Try and test] your first chart.

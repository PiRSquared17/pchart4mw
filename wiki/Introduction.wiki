#summary Introduction to PHP Chart for Mediawiki

=== What is pChart4mw ? ===
pChart4mw is a Mediawiki extension for visualizing data in different kinds of charts, all within a Mediawiki page. With pChart4mw you can create professional looking charts like line, bar, pie, radar, scatter and bubble charts.

===How it works===
As a wiki author you create a chart definition within a wiki page. To do this _you type_ simple chart syntax plus the data to be displayed in the chart. pchart4mw processes your chart definition and uses the pChart library to create a chart image. Browsing the wiki page _you get_ your chart image displayed.

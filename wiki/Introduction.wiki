=== What is pChart4mw? ===
PHP chart for !MediaWiki (pChart4mw) is a !MediaWiki extension for visualizing data in different types of charts, all within a !MediaWiki page. With pChart4mw you can create professional looking charts like line, bar, pie, radar, scatter and bubble charts. To enable full flexibility and full integration with other extensions pchart4mw supports both the standard !MediaWiki tag syntax plus the parser function syntax.

===How it works===
As a wiki author you create a chart definition within a wiki page. To do this _you type_ simple chart syntax plus the data to be displayed in the chart. pchart4mw processes your chart definition and uses the pChart library to create a chart image. Browsing the wiki page _you get_ your chart image displayed.

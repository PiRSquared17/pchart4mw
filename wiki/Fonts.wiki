#summary Using fonts

=== Introduction ===
Fonts are used to create text in charts along x- and y-axes, labels, legend and title. pChart4mw enables you to set your preferred font for text and for the title seperately.

=== Setting preferred font ===
You can set the preferred font in two ways:

 # For your whole site
 # For each chart individual
 
If no general preference is configured the default font is tahoma.

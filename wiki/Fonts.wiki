#summary Using fonts

=== Introduction ===
Fonts are used to create text in charts along x- and y-axes, labels, legend and title. pChart4mw enables you to set your preferred font for text and for the title seperately.

=== Using fonts===
There are two ways to use fonts:
 * You can set your own default fonts in the configuration of pChart4mw. This colorscheme will then be used as default for all the charts unless other fonts are defined for a specific chart. See also paragraph default settings in the [Configuration#Default_settings configuration] page. For example:
{{{
$wgPChart4mwDefaults = Array ( "textfont" => "mini.ttf", "textsize" => "5" ); 
}}}
 * You can set a preferred font in a chart definition (see [Parameters#Text text parameters]). For example:
{{{
textfont=mini.ttf textsize=5 titlefont=georgia.ttf titlesize=12
}}}
If no preference is configured the default font is tahoma.

Good practice: We consider configuring preferred fonts for the whole wiki site a good practice. It provides uniformity in your charts.

=== Samples ===
Underneath are two samples of the same chart. The left chart uses a 'mini' font and the right chart uses the default 'tahoma' font. Both look good but the 'mini' font gives sharp and perfectly aligned text in the labels and in the legend.

#summary Run pchart4mw as webservice

=== Introduction ===

pchart4mw can be run as a webservice.
Note: this is advanced use and will be documented later. The documentation on this page is as-is and incomplete


=== Configuration ===

If you leave this parameter emtpy, no webservice is used. That is also the default value.
To use it as a webservice add the following line to `LocalSettings.php`:
{{{
$wgPChart4mwWebservice = "http://localhost:8000/wiki/extensions/pChart4mw/pChartWebservice.php";
}}}

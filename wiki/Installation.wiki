This page describes the installation and configuration of the pChart library AND the pChart4mw extension. Most steps for installation and configuration are the same as for other Mediawiki extensions. When you follow the following steps, the extension should work within minutes.

=== Step 1: Install the pChart library ===
The first thing you need is a copy of the pChart library. Download the latest version from the pChart website [http://pchart.sourceforge.net/ here...] <br>Follow the instructions for pChart installation. The location where pChart is installed must be specified later on in {{{LocalSettings.php}}}. Remember this location. Check the system requirements for the pChart library. _(your PHP installation needs to have GD library with freetype extension enabled)_ 
Locations for the pChart library are, for example: <br>
 # Option 1: pChart library installed in {{{[documentroot]/pChart/pChart.class}}} 
 # Option 2: pChart library installed in {{{$IP/extensions/pChart4mw/pChart/pChart.class}}} _(sub-directory of pchart4mw extension)_ 

After extraction you should have the files:
{{{
...pChart/Fonts/
         /Fonts/*.ttf
         /pChart.class
         /pChart.class.php
         /pCache.class
         /pData.class
}}}
Please note that pChart4mw is tested with pChart library version 1.27d.

=== Step 2: Install the pchart4mw extension ===
Download the PHP scripts from our download page and extract them into the directory
{{{
$IP/extensions/pChart4mw
}}}
After extraction you should have the files:
{{{
$IP/extensions/pChart4mw/colorschemes/
                        /colorschemes/*.txt
                        /pChart4mw.php
                        /pChart4mw.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.bars.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.bubble.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.lines.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.pie.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.radar.php
                        /pChart4mw.scatter.class.php
                        /library.inc.php
                        /changes.txt
}}}


=== Step 3: Tell Mediawiki about this extension ==
Once the files are installed you need to let Mediawiki know about this extension. Add the following line to the file {{{LocalSettings.php}}}
{{{
require_once( "$IP/extensions/pChart4mw/pChart4mw.php" );
}}}

Define the location where pChart library is installed. This variable contains the absolute path to the directory where the pChart class resides. Add the following line to `LocalSettings.php`:

Option 1: point to `[documentroot]/pChart/pChart.class` with:
{{{
$wgPChart4mwPChartPath = $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . "/pchart";
}}}

Option 2: point to `$IP/extensions/pChart4mw/pChart/pChart.class` with: 
{{{
$wgPChart4mwPChartPath = $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . "/wiki/extensions/pChart4mw/pChart";
}}}

=== Configure the extension ===
Your setup is good to go. There are several optional configuration options you might like to add to `LocalSettings.php`. (Recommended is to do this after testing [YourFirstGraph your first chart]). 


More information about the configuration can be found in the section [Configuration configuration].

This page describes the default installation and initial configuration of the pChart4mw extension version 1.3.0<sup>+</sup>. Most steps of the installation and configuration are the same as for other !MediaWiki extensions. When you follow the following steps, the extension should work within minutes.

=== Step 0: Check requirements===
You need a up-and-running !MediaWiki wiki-site. Make sure that the PHP version on your server is 5.x and has GD library with freetype extension enabled. pChart4mw has proven to work well with !MediaWiki versions 1.12 ... 1.16 (including its new vector skin).<br><font size="2" color="#7B7B7B">(Note: Do not use PHP5.3.1, it has a bug in it and is not supported to run with !MediaWiki.)</font>

Check other requirments on the [ReleaseNotes release notes] page.

=== Step 1: Install the pChart4mw extension ===
Download the pChart4mw extension (zip-file) from our download page or [ReleaseNotes release notes page] and extract it into your new <tt>pChart4mw</tt> extension folder:
{{{
$IP/extensions/pChart4mw
}}}
After extraction you should have these files and sub-folders:
{{{
$IP/extensions/pChart4mw/colorschemes/
                        /colorschemes/*.txt
                        /fonts/
                        /fonts/*.ttf
                        /pChart/
                        /pChart/*.class
                        /pChart4mw.php
                        /pChart4mw.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.bars.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.bubble.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.lines.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.pie.class.php
                        /pChart4mw.radar.php
                        /pChart4mw.scatter.class.php
                        /library.inc.php
                        /changes.txt
                        /licence.txt
}}}

=== Step 2: Tell !MediaWiki about this extension ==
Once the files are installed you need to let !MediaWiki know about this extension. Add the following line to the file {{{LocalSettings.php}}}
{{{
require_once( "$IP/extensions/pChart4mw/pChart4mw.php" );
}}}

=== Step 3: Check the cache folder ==
Before you start using the wiki with this new extension. Make sure underneath folder exists and is writeable. (this is de default cache folder of pchart4mw).

{{{
$IP/images/pChart4mw/
}}}

Your setup is good to go. 

=== Configure the extension ===
There are additional configuration options you might like to set to customize pchart4mw to your personal preferences. (Recommended is to do this after testing [YourFirstGraph your first chart]). 

Information about configuration of pchart4mw can be found in the section [Configuration configuration].

===Maintenance===
Important: As administrator of the wiki site make sure to read the [SiteMaintenance maintenance] instructions.

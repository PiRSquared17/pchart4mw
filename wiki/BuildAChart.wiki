#summary How to build a chart

This page leads you through a simple step-by-step process to build a chart with pChart4mw.

A chart can be included in a wiki page using special tags. An example of such a XML-tag is `<pBars>` or `<pPie>`. For every type of chart, a different tag is available. This page shows step by step how a bar chart is made. Other types of charts are made in a similar way, using another tag. More information about other types of charts can be found on the pages linked above.

=== Step 1: Initial tags ===
As explained, creating a chart starts with the XML-tag. Every tag has an opening part `<pBars>` and a closing part `</pBars>`. 
<table><tr><td>
{{{
<pbars></pbars>
}}}
</td>
<td><pbars size=50x50></pbars></td></tr>
</table>

=== Step 2: Entering data ===
The tags above result in an empty chart. That is correct. To show a chart, some data has to be entered. The data can be entered between the opening and closing tag in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values CSV-style]. That means: every value must be entered on a new line.
<table><tr><td>
{{{
<pbars>
5345
3452
7843
</pbars>
}}}
</td>
<td>`<pbars size=200x150>
5345
3452
7843
</pbars>`
</td></tr></table>

=== Step 3: Adding labels ===
Every line results in a new bar in the chart. Many times a bar should be labeled to give the chart more meaning. The label will be shown beneath the bar. In this case, the different values belong to different months:
<table><tr><td>
{{{
<pbars>
Oct,5345
Nov,3452
Dec,7843
</pbars>
}}}
</td>
<td>
`<pbars size=200x150>
Oct,5345
Nov,3452
Dec,7843
</pbars>`
</td></tr></table>

=== Step 4: Multiple series ===
It is also possible to compare multiple series of data. These series are shown as bars with different colors next to eachother. Every color denotes a specific serie. 
<table><tr><td>
{{{
<pbars>
Oct,5345,3110,1291
Nov,3452,3695,1047
Dec,7843,4712,1305
</pbars>
}}}
</td><td>
`<pbars size=200x150>
Oct,5345,3110,1291
Nov,3452,3695,1047
Dec,7843,4712,1305
</pbars>`
</td></tr></table>

=== Step 5: Labeling series ===
Every serie can also be labeled. This is done by entering labels on the first row. These labels can be shown in a legend.

*N.B.* The label must be in the same column as the data it belongs to. The columns are separated by a comma and the first column contains the labels for the x-axis. Therefore the first label for the series is prepended with a comma.
<table><tr><td>
{{{
<pbars legend>
,Europe,United States,Asia
Oct,5345,3110,1291
Nov,3452,3695,1047
Dec,7843,4712,1305
</pbars>
}}}
</td><td>`<pbars size=300x150 legend>
,Europe,United States,Asia
Oct,5345,3110,1291
Nov,3452,3695,1047
Dec,7843,4712,1305
</pbars>`
</td></tr></table>

=== Step 6: Style the graph ===
Apart from the data in the graph, you can control the look and feel of the graph using different [parameters]. Examples of parameters are the title and colors. 
<table><tr><td>
{{{
<pbars size=300x150 title="Site Visitors" ymin=0 ymax=10000 legend>
,Europe,United States,Asia
Oct,5345,3110,1291
Nov,3452,3695,1047
Dec,7843,4712,1305
</pbars>
}}}
</td><td>
`<pbars size=300x150 title="Site Visitors" ymin=0 ymax=10000 legend>
,Europe,United States,Asia
Oct,5345,3110,1291
Nov,3452,3695,1047
Dec,7843,4712,1305
</pbars>`
</td></tr></table>

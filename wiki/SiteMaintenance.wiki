#summary Maintenance for your Mediawiki site

=== Cached files ===
As described in the [TechnicalOverview technical overview], pchart4mw stores chart images in the cache folder (default: ../images/pchart4mw/). The filenames of these images are automatically generated based on the full content of the pchart4mw call. This means that every time the content of a call changes the filename of the created image also changes.

A filename is for example: 4011db4213c05eed3f30f6a350072995.png

=== Clean up ===
Over time the cache folder becomes populated with unused (orphan) graph images. Periodically the wiki site administrator should do some clean up in cache folder. 

It is recommended to delete *all* cached image files in cache folder once in a while. Chart images will be (re)created whenever a page is viewed and pchart4mw discovers the chart image doesn't exist. The frequency of this clean up depends on the intensity of use of your site.

===<font color=#999900> pChart library 2.x </font>===

pChart4mw uses the pChart Library to generate the chart images. A new major release of the pChart Library (pChart 2.x) has been released in January 2011. Links to pChart 2.x are:

 * http://www.pchart.net
 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/pchart/

Please take note of the following regarding pChart 2.x
 # As is stated on the pChart 2.x site pChart 2.x is not compatible with its predecessor pChart 1.27d. Therefore pChart4mw 1.x will not work with pChart 2.x.
 # Although pChart 1.x is no longer maintained there are no plans to migrate pChart4mw to pChart 2.x, pChart4mw will remain using pChart 1.x for some time.

===<font color=#999900> Developments </font>===

pChart4mw uses the pChart Library to generate the chart images. It seems that a new major release of the pChart Library is in process. Related links to pChart Library 2 are:

 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/pchart/
 * http://wiki.pchart.net/doc.installation.html

Note: pChart Library 2 is a work in progress. As is stated on the pChart 2.0 site (introduction, on August 20<sup>th</sup> 2010) pChart library 2.x is not compatible with pChart Library 1.x. Therefore pChart4mw 1.x is also not compatible with pChart library 2.x.

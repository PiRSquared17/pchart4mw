#summary Using colorschemes.

=== Introduction ===
A colorscheme is a set of colors that will be applied to your data series in order to make them visually different. pChart4mw can work with pre-defined colorschemes. The download of pChart4mw comes with a few [#Standard_colorschemes standard colorschemes]: accent, blue, greenblue, original, paired, purpleblue, softblue and wave. <br>
Of course you can also easily [#Make_your_own create your own].

=== Using colorschemes ===
There are two ways to use colorschemes:
 * You can set your own default colorscheme in configuration of pChart4mw. This colorscheme will then be used as default for all the charts unless other colors or colorschemes are defined for the specific chart. See also paragraph default settings in the [Configuration#Default_settings configuration] page. For example:
{{{
$wgPChart4mwDefaults = Array ( "size" => "200x120", "colorscheme" => "blue" );
}}}
 * You can call a preferred scheme in a chart definition (see [Parameters#Colors color parameters]). For example:
{{{
colorscheme=accent
}}}

Note: Colorscheme _blue_ has the same colors as _softblue_ only in reverse order 

=== Make your own ===
A colorscheme is a simple text file, that is stored in the colorschemes folder of pChart4mw. Its filename is the name of the colorscheme and it always has extension ".txt"

To create your own colorscheme simply make a new colorscheme textfile with 6 to 8 RGB (Red Green Blue) colors. <br>
Tip: _We advise to make colorschemes with six to eight colors so that there are enough colors in it for different data sets._

For example create a text file with the name wave.txt containing:
{{{
204,230,254
153,204,254
128,179,230
102,153,204
51,102,153
254,254,204
230,230,179
217,217,139
}}}
And you've created colorscheme "wave" with these colors:

Note: Be aware of the fact that not every set of colors is usable for every type of chart. A line chart for example needs better distinguishable colors than a bar chart.

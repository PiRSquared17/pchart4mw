#summary Using colorsschemes.

=== Introduction ===

pChart4mw can work with pre-defined colorschemes. The standard download of pChart4mw comes with a few default colorschemes like accent.txt, original.txt, softblue.txt, etc... You can also easily create your own.

=== Using colorschemes ===
There are two ways to use colorschemes:
 * You can set your own default colorscheme in configuration of pChart4mw. This colorscheme will them be used as default for all the charts unless other colors or colorschems are defined with the chart. See also paragraph Default settings in the [Configuration configuration] page.
 * You can call a preferred scheme in a chart definition (see [Parameters parameters]). For example:
{{{
colorscheme=accent
}}}

=== Make your own ===
A colorscheme is a simple text file, that is stored in the colorschemes folder of pChart4mw. Its filename is the name of the colorscheme and it always has an extension ".txt"

To create your own colorscheme simply make a new colorscheme textfile with eight RGB colors.

<td>pChart4mw requires PHP with GD Library and freetype extension enabled. To check if your PHP installation matches these requirements you need te aquire the PHP settings. Make a text file named phpinfo.php with the following content:
{{{
<?php

// Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
phpinfo();
?>
}}}
Then with your browser, browser to this page: http:\\...\phpinfo.php, ... being the URL to where you placed the file.

Youlll see a lot of PHP info as output. Search for "freetype" and under the header gd you can see whether or not GD and freetype are enabled.

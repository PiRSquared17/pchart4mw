<dt>Q: How do I check the PHP settings of my server?</dt>
<dt>A: pChart4mw requires PHP with GD Library and freetype extension enables. To check if your PHP installation matches these requirements make a text file named phpinfo.php with the following content:
{{{
<?php

// Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
phpinfo();
?>
}}}
The with your browser, browser tot this page: http:\\...\phpinfo.php, ... being the URL to where you placed the file.

You will see a lot of PHP info as output. Search for "freetype" and under the header gd you can see if GD and freetype are enabled or not.
